Hello,
My name is Sasa and I am from Bosnia. I graduated with a Bachelor Business Informatics Degree and I submited my application for Computer Science Master Degree in Austria. While studying, I worked as a Web Developer for a marketing agency, and later, for NCR(the global leader in ATM software applications and POS systems) as Helpdesk Representative/IT Support (network, administration, software/hardware etc.)
To be honest with you, I have never worked as a freelancer, but I am determined to become one. I can assure you that I am the "right guy" for this position and I would invest my whole time to fulfil your expectations.

Best Regards,

Sasa

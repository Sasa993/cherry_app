- run ChatBots for promoting and generating traffic for user's Shopify store
- User registers > connects his Shopify store/stores > sets up up to 150 Instagram accounts within his account (different tabs with different Instagram accounts) > people should be able sign in with their Instagram credentials > auto-comments(Spintax format - add different words and it will randomly generate a string - so that it's not too obvious that you're using a bot), leave likes and auto-respond to messages (in a sequence - when you receive a message, wait 2 minutes then answer etc.)
- there is no need for "active" messaging (texting people without them texting us first)
- proxy functionality (two Instagram accounts always have to share the same IP address) - there's already a service that can be used to accomplish this (via API)
- phone verification - service smspva.com (API for SMS validation)
- search for posts that are marked with certain hastag (basic bots' functionality)
